\section{Introduction}
In the modern industrial landscape, predictive maintenance has emerged as a critical strategy for minimizing equipment downtime and optimizing performance. Traditional maintenance approaches, which are often reactive, lead to unplanned downtimes, increased operational costs, and potential safety hazards. Predictive maintenance, on the other hand, leverages data from Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices to forecast equipment failures before they occur, allowing for timely and efficient maintenance actions \cite{lee2018predictive, kang2016smart}.

However, the implementation of predictive maintenance in industrial settings faces significant challenges, particularly in terms of data security and integrity. IIoT systems generate vast amounts of sensitive data, which must be securely collected, stored, and analyzed to ensure accurate predictions. The traditional centralized data management systems are prone to security breaches and data tampering, which can compromise the reliability of the maintenance predictions \cite{atzori2010internet}.

Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to these challenges by providing a decentralized, immutable ledger that ensures data integrity and security. StarkNet, a Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, enhances these benefits with its high throughput, low costs, and native support for account abstraction \cite{ben2019starknet}. By integrating blockchain with IIoT, it is possible to create a robust and secure platform for predictive maintenance.

This paper introduces \textit{StarkPredict}, a blockchain-enabled predictive maintenance platform that leverages StarkNet for secure and scalable data management. The platform integrates real-time monitoring, advanced predictive analytics, and automated maintenance workflows through smart contracts. \textit{StarkPredict} addresses the current challenges in IIoT data security, ensuring that the data used for maintenance predictions is reliable and tamper-proof.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in the field of predictive maintenance and blockchain applications in IIoT. Section 3 describes the system architecture of \textit{StarkPredict}, including its backend, frontend, and blockchain integration. Section 4 details the predictive maintenance model and its implementation. Section 5 discusses the web interface and user experience. Section 6 covers the implementation and deployment process. Section 7 presents the results and performance analysis, and Section 8 concludes the paper with a discussion on the impact and future work.

\noindent\textbf{Existing Solutions and Gaps}

Existing solutions for predictive maintenance and IIoT data security often rely on centralized systems, which are vulnerable to security breaches and data tampering. Blockchain-based approaches, such as those discussed by IBM and other researchers \cite{ibm2019blockchain}, provide a more secure and decentralized alternative. However, there is a need for scalable and efficient platforms that can seamlessly integrate blockchain with IIoT systems, providing real-time monitoring and predictive analytics.
